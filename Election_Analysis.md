## Election-Audit Summary: 
In it's completed form, the PyPoll_Challenge.py executable proves to be a versatile piece of code. While able to deliver an accurate analysis of county votes, winners, and vote percentages, PyPoll_Challenge.py could easily be modified to provide wide range analysis for multiple different elections. By keeping the variables general in nature with no location specific identifiers, another csv file could easily be analyzed. By updating the path to point to a different csv, the end user could quickly analyze a new file, with minimal code change.
